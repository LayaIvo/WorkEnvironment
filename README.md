* How do you deal with an overly demanding coworker? (Paywall)

    "A coworker is not your boss. Feel free to ignore, delay, or defer this person’s demands. Put them off by saying things like, “I’ll need to think about it,” or “I’m not sure I can help you with that right now.” You may want to have a word with your boss, and let them know what has been going on. Otherwise, this coworker might just complain about you if you stop being cooperative."
